# General Financial Advice
## Initial Notes
Many people have asked me to give them general financial advice. This document distills the core of that advice. I am not a financial advisor. I'm a self-taught investor and want to share some of the strategies and tactics that I feel that helped me in my financial journey.

## General Principles
### Wealthbuilding is a marathon. 
For most of us, building a high net worth will take 3 to 4 decades. Be patient. Play the long game. Believe in the power of compounding. Invest in tried and true assets and don't waste resources (both financial and emotional) on the flavor of the day.

### Never bet against America. 
Keep your investments in the United States and you won't regret it. Over the long term, America has the right system for financial success. In the short term, it can be a bumpy ride. Have faith in America.

### Automate everything. 
From investments to paying debts & bills, take advantage of the automated programs. It reduces the risk of mistakes, missed payments & missed investments, and decision-making fatigue.

### Use large, trusted institutions to make your investments. 
Big financial institutions will be able to protect your money during deep recessions and will be able to offer high-value services at reasonable cost and with excellent service. I like Vanguard and Fidelity.

## Reading & Resources
I recommend the following books and resources that I used to learn about investing.
- [The Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins](https://bookshop.org/a/11815/9781533667922) -- Definitely start with this book. It's a quick read and well written.
- [Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholder Letters by Warren Buffett](https://berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html) -- I never miss this. Go back and read them all. Good lessons about how to be a profitable investor.
- [Financial Peace University by Dave Ramsey](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/ramseyplus/financial-peace) -- A video course that explains all the basics.
- [I Will Teach You To Be Rich by Ramit Sethi](https://bookshop.org/a/11815/9781523505746) -- Scammy title. Great book.
- [The Truth About Money by Ric Edelman](https://bookshop.org/a/11815/9780062006486) -- This is a dense, high yield book. Really great overall primer and explains basic concepts of personal finance. Read it twice.
- [The Millionaire Next Door](https://bookshop.org/a/11815/9781589795471) --  A great book that reviews the demographics of rich people. 

## Build a Budget
This is most important advice that I will give. You need to create a budget that captures the inflows and outflows of money and tracks your assets and debts. I recommend using the budgeting website [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com). 

For the first few months, just track everything you do with money to get a sense of where everything is going. It took me about six months to really understand how I make and spend money. Then I used that information to create a budget.

## Payoff Debts First
The next step is getting rid of all consumer debt (credit card, personal loans, car payments, student loans, etc). There are only two exceptions to this rule: Home Mortgages and any debt with an interest rate of 3% or less. Pay the minimum on these exceptions and invest the rest. 

The order in which you pay your debts does not matter. But, I would recommend prioritizing the payoff of higher interest debts first.  

## Fund Cash Account
Once your debts are paid off (exceptions notwithstanding), then it's time to put money into your cash fund. I recommend placing 5% of your gross income in cash in a high-yield savings account. You will do this for the rest of your working life. You'll need the cash to pay for larger expenses such as financial emergencies, cars, medical expenses and a down payment for a house.

The actual amount of cash you need to save is dependent on your goals and may exceed 5%.

## Next Invest
Once your debts are paid off and you have the 5% allocation for cash, then it is time to invest. Put 15% of each paycheck in investments. Max them out in this order:

1. 401k
2. IRA
3. Brokerage Account 

Automate all investments. Set it and forget it.

If you are just starting, it will take a few months to get up to the full 15%. If you can afford to invest more than 15%, then do so. 

Allocate your investments as follows:
- 90% total US stock market index fund (VTSAX or equivalent)
- 10% total US bond market index fund (VBTLX or equivalent )
- As you approach retirement, this allocation will change.

### 401k
Max out your employer's 401k. It doesn't matter if you do a Roth 401k or not. Maximize any excess contributions if your plan allows it.

### IRA
Max out your IRA. Here, do Roth if possible, otherwise do the traditional contribution.

If your income is too high to use a Roth IRA tax deduction, don't worry -- just contribute to the Traditional IRA and record the transaction on Tax Form 8606. Keep it updated annually. In the future, you'll be able to withdraw money from the IRA in a tax advantaged way or do a Roth conversion.
 
### Brokerage Account
After maxing out the 401k and IRA investments, I would keep it very simple. I would open a brokerage account in Vanguard or Fidelity and start making investments there at the usual allocation of stocks and bonds.

Another option: If you feel uncomfortable opening a brokerage account and managing the investments yourself, you can try a RoboAdvisor. I would recommend Betterment, Wealthfront or Vanguard Digital Advisor. There will be a small fee for these RoboAdvisors. 

### Mutual fund or ETF?
I prefer mutual funds over ETFs. It is easier to automate investments with mutual funds at the large brokerage houses such as Vanguard or Fidelity.

It should be noted that some of the newer fintech companies, such as Robinhood, do allow automatic investments into ETFs.

### Investing in crypto, other types of ETFs and mutual funds and real estate?
I would recommend only allocating a total of 5% of your investments to individual stocks and exotic investment types.

## Where to Park Your Money

### High Yield Saving Accounts
I would stick to very large name brand banks that have FDIC insurance. Examples include Ally (formerly GMAC) and Marcus (Goldman Sachs). 

I recommend making a specific point to keep checking and savings accounts in different banks. 

As a general rule, I stay away from Bank of America and Wells Fargo as they are not customer friendly. I would stay away from cash accounts in the newer fintech player as they are not yet tested for stability in long term and deep recessions. 

### Brokerage Accounts/IRAs
For your Brokerage and IRAs accounts, I would choose either Fidelity, Charles Schwab and/or Vanguard  because of their size and stability. They are user friendly and offer excellent customer service.
